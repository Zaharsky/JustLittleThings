# Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2].
# Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

    for Num in range (1,NumofElements+1):
        List.append(List.pop(0))
    return List
Mylist=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
