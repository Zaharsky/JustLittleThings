# Use it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found
#  by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares
#  are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect square
#  because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12. (This question is tricky
#  if your programming language makes it difficult to pass functions as arguments.)
